# Island Counter

Try solving the islands matrix problem:
```python
# Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns the number of 1 islands. An island 
# consists of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west. For example:

islands = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]

island_counter(islands) # returns 4

```
